# DA6401 Assignment 2 - CNNs and Fine-tuning

## Description

This repository contains the solution for Assignment 2 of DA6401, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.  The assignment involves two main parts:

*   **Part A:** Training a CNN model from scratch on a subset of the iNaturalist dataset.  This includes designing the model architecture, tuning hyperparameters, and analyzing the results.
*   **Part B:** Fine-tuning a pre-trained model (from Torchvision) on the same iNaturalist dataset.  This involves adapting the pre-trained model and experimenting with different fine-tuning strategies.
